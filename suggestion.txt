addressing mode need to be decide. basically problem with 2 optioins
1. memory direct addressing
2. indirect register addressing

1. memory direct addressing
memory address is 16 bit log. so instruction lenght will be incresed unnecessary.

2. indirect register addressing
each time we have to load the memory address to a known register before doing any operation.
